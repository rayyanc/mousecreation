Contrary to C060, which is a **c**apacitator, R0603 is a **r**esistor, with the numbers referring to its size: a length of 0.030" and width of 0.030". Volkan will have to know the specific voltage that the resistor to be bought can control.

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element, with its specific chemical composition. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.
