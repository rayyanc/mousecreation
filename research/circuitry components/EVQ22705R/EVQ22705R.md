EVQ22705R is a type of button/switch. It is 6mm in length and is a short push travel type, meaning that it is very sensitive and does not require much motion for activation.

Most major companies have stopped manufacturing this switch, but it can be found in 50pc sets on [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/2255801111900272.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt). We may want to find an alternative switch with similar specifications.
