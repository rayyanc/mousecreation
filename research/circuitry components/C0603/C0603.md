C0603 is a ceramic capacitator, where the ceramic is dielectric, with multiple layers of alternating ceramic and metal layers that assist in its ability to hold electricity, with the ceramic acting as an insulator. There are two classes: Class 1, which is more stable, and Class 2, which has higher volumetric efficiency, but is less stable. I don't know which class is the one that is needed in our mouse.
