This should be a crystal oscillator, which is used to keep track of time, as it provides a stable clock for digital integrated circuits. When a piece of quartz is met with an electical current, it changes shape; when the current is removed, the quartz emits a small amount of electricity as it returns back to its original shape. It is not only a highly stable material, but its rate of changing shape is constant, allowing it to be utilized as a clock.
