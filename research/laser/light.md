#The Lamp
Red is the most common color used by the lamp, since they are the most inexpensive. Originally, the LED was used to project the light, but have since been replaced by the infrared laser diode, which allows for higher precision of the images created.

#Power
Usually, the lamp on the mice has four unique power states, to save energy.
11500: full on, for accurate response while moving, illumination appears bright.
1100: fallback active condition while not moving, illumination appears dull.
110: standby
12: sleep state
