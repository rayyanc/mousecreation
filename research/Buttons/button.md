Left click button
This is the most used button on the mouse. It is considered the “action” button, and is what you will use to click on most things.

Right click button
This button is used to gain context or extra information. When you right-click on something, you will usually get a menu or list of actions to choose from.

Scroll wheel & middle button
The scroll wheel is the bump between the left and right mouse buttons. You can use your index finger to roll it forwards or backwards. When you are browsing the internet or reading a word document or PDF, the scroll wheel will move the page up or down, so that you can read more of the page. When you use it on a map or full-screen image it will zoom in or out. The scroll wheel also acts as a third button if you press directly down without scrolling, which usually activates a button-free type of scrolling that reacts to the direction you move the cursor on the screen.

A mouse button is an electric switch on a computer mouse which can be pressed (“clicked”) to select or interact with an element of a graphical user interface. Mouse buttons are most commonly implemented as miniature snap-action switches (micro switches).

Douglas Engelbart's first mouse had a single button; Xerox PARC soon designed a three-button model, but reduced the count to two for Xerox products. Apple decided on one button for their GUI environments on commercial release in 1983, while most other PC environments standardized on two, and most professional workstation environments used three. Aside from such OEM bundled mice, usually having between one and three buttons, many aftermarket mice have always had five or more, with varying amounts of additional software included to support them.

Scrollmice almost always mount their scroll wheels on an internal spring-loaded frame and switch, so that simply pushing down makes them work as an extra button, made easier to do without accidentally spinning it by wheel detents present in most scrollmice. The wheel can both be rotated and clicked, thus most mice today effectively have three buttons.
