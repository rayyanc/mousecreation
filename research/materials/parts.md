[3d printing]: We will 3d print the casing for the mouse using our model that I have created in blender

[Plastic Casing]: The outer shell of the mouse is typically made of plastic, providing durability and a comfortable grip.
[Circuit Board]: This is kinda like the heart of the mouse, containing the electronic components that enable its functionality.
[Microcontroller]: The microcontroller processes the input from the mouse and communicates with the computer.
[Buttons]: The primary buttons for left and right clicking, as well as any additional buttons for functions like scrolling or gaming.
[Scroll Wheel]: If your mouse design includes a scroll wheel, you'll need this component for navigating web pages and documents.
[Optical Sensor]: For modern mice, an optical sensor tracks movement and relays it to the computer.
[LEDs]: If you want your mouse to have visual indicators or lighting, you'll need LEDs for this purpose.
[Wiring]: Various wires and connectors are required to link the components together and transmit signals.
[USB Cable]: For a wired mouse, a USB cable is necessary to connect the mouse to the computer.
[Feet/Pads]: These are the small pads on the bottom of the mouse that allow it to glide smoothly over surfaces so its not rough.
