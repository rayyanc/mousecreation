Mouse skates are often applied to the bottoms of mouses to reduce friction and increase accuracy.
Since they slightly elevate the mouse above the surface that the mouse is gliding on and makes it so the mouse has less contact with the tabletop/mousepad, mouse skates ensure that the mouse is able to glide smoothly and without bumps. Thus, the user is able to better handle and control their mouse.

Mouse skates are often bought online, and are made of polytetrafluoroethylene, or Teflon. Their prices can range from $10-30+.
