	<h2>Casing</h2>
	<p>The electronics of a mouse are often encased in a piece of plastic casing. This would be created by 3D printing. Different types of mice have unique casings, but the most basic of mice would have two buttons, a scroll wheel, and an area for a person to grip the mouse. Some mice are made to be more ergonomic and comfortable to handle, while office mice, like ours, are basic and straightforard.</p>
